# CS Treasure Hunt

A shoddily-made website to keep track of the **10+ locations** *(why???)* for core Computing materials, as well as other helpful resources.

Intended for Term 2 of 1st Year for the 2020-21 academic year at Imperial College London.

Helpful suggestions (either in issues or pull requests) welcome!
